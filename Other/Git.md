# What is git
Branches are a pain in the ass
 NOT GITHUB

 - Version control system
	 - track changes
	 - manage multiple branches
	 - roll between versions

# What is github
- free repo hosting service
	- central location for many open source projs
- git is to github as hammer is to wall

# Why
- collaboration
- efficiency
- may not be code


# Commits
- checkpoint, snapshot of code
- commit directly to `main` branch but pls dont its horrible
- can have commit message
- view what was changed in commit log
- see a diff: visual tool to see diff
- git and github only store differences

# Cloning
- you dont have permission to push to main. use fork instead.

# Staging
- choose what to commit
- editing afterwards is possible
- commit when done

# Sync changes
- Commits and are to local repo
- Click sync (both pull and push)
- Can be done anytime
- Same as fetch origin
Make sure up to date on local branch and remote branch

Clone -> edit -> stage -> commit -> edit cont.
sync

# Branching
- sth like save as
- watch out for what branch you are on

# Merging
- contribute
- open pull request
