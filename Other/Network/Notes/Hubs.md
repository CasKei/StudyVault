## More than 2 machines
- More than 2 mchiens can be connected to a hub.
- A hub is dumb
- It just sends everything it receives back out to all ports
- Machines ignore frames not intended for them so everything is mostly fine
- Everything that worked for 2 machines works the same way
- But
	- Slow (10 Mbit, 100Mbit if lucky)
	- Collisions (Machines wana talk over each other)
	- We can do better. [[Switches]]
