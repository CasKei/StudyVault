## Intro
-  Term used to descr continuous evolution of growing cyber threat landscape
- Revers to the complete universe of tools, practices, rules that protect data asses from malicious actors
- Components: People, Process, Technology
## Cyber Threats
### Intro to threats
Cyber threats
- Malicious acts that seek to damage data, steal data or disrupt digital life in general
- actions or events thatcould lead to unwanted impact on IT infrastructures
- e.g. Samsung leak by Lapsus$ on 03/03/2022 - 03/05/2022
- e.g. CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell)
	- CVSS score 10 (highest)
	- concepts: Log4j, JNDI, LDAP
	- $(java:version)
	- ![[Pasted image 20220619111906.png]]


### Types of Threats
- [[Social Engineering]]
- [[Ransomware]]
- [[DDos attacks]]
- [[Cryptojacking]]
- etc
### Sources of Threats
- Hostile Nation-states
	- national cyber warfare programs pose emerging cyber threats ranging from propaganda, website defacement, espionage, disruption of key infratructure to loss of life
- Terrorist groups
	- increasingly using cyberattacks to damge national interests
- Unhappy insiders
	- common source of cyber crime
	- insiders dont often need a high degree of computer knowledge to expose sensitive data because they may already be authorised
- Accidental actions of authorised users
	- poor configuration
- Corporate spies and organised crime organisations
	- poses a risk due to their ability to conduct industrial espoinage to steal trade secrets or large scale monetary theft
- Hackers
	- malicious intruders could take advantage of a zero-day exploit to gain unauthorised access to data
	- hachers may break into information systems for a challenge or bragging rights
### Defense for Businesses and Individuals
- Businesses
	- patching systems
- Individuals
	- password hygiene
	- anti-virus software
	- keep system up to date with automated scheduled scans
	- caution against phishing attacks

## Trends in 2022
### Biometrics
The measurement and statistical analysis of people's unique physical and behavioural characteristics
### Blockchain
Small data called blocks are stored in a chain-type, link-based distributed data storage environment created based on the P2P method.
This is a data forgery prevention technology based on distributed computing technology that cannotbe arbitrarily modified by anyone and everyone can view the results of the change.
In 2022, we will see blockchain become a more common tool used by cyber criminals to obfuscate their malicious traffic, avoid detection, and extend attacker's stealth, making it increasingly harder for defenders to discern malicious activity on the network
### Cloud
Cloud is Internet. It is a metaphor for the internet
Cloud service:
- services provided by the internet

With malware developers all racing to program cross-platform languages, targeting linux machiens and opting for new and less familiar programming languages, the cloud is becoming more popular as it can provide significant data protection advantage and recovery options.
Cloud security will become more important in 2022

[[CSPM(Cloud Security Posture Management)]]

### IOT
Connecting any device to the Internetand to other connected devices
Computing devices embedded in IoT products allow sending and receiving data over the internet
As IoT connects the virtual space and the physical world, home intrusions are being added to the list of critical threats that IoT brings.
### Mobile
Mobile devices as Attack Vectors
As of 2021, 66.6% of the population will use mobile devices (DataReportal, 2021)
Mobile devices are becoming a great channel of opportunity for cybercriminals as users continue to use their mobile devices for personal and business communications, as well as banking, shopping, flight, hotel bookings. 
These devices have been the target of cyberattacks and will continue to exist in 2022.

Mobile Malware
In 2004, the world's first mobile malware, Cabir, appeared
RAT(Remote Access Tools): a type of malware that allows hackers to monitor and control your computer or mobile device
RATs may be used to send SMS messages, enable device cameras, and log GPS data
### Finance
While phishing remain prevalent, it is no longer only carried out via emails.
Phishing through social media and other messaging platfors is one of the cybersecurity trends in financial services.

| Phishing | early 2020, an officer from a statutory board received emails from a colleague's email, requesting for an urgent transfer of >1mil to an unfamiliar bank acct. A cybercriminal had gained access to his colleague's acct through a phishing email, and sent a total of 6 emails to other staff to trick them into transferring money to the bank acct. |
| Malware  | 23 dec 2020 a local org affected by SolarWinds breach. One of the affected org's IT systems, which had SolarWinds Orion installed, downloaded the infected update and thus was exposed to the malware.                                                                                                                                                 |
|          | aug 2020 a staff from F&B business found their servers and devices were infected with NetWalker, a prevalent ransomware strain. The ransom note instructed the victim to visit a webpage on the Dark Web to view ransom demans. As company had also stored backups on affected servers, none of the data could be recovered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

### Singapore Cybersecurity Strategy in 2021
Outlines SG goals and approach to adapt to a rapidly evolving strategic and technological environment.
Threat actors are becoming mroe sophisticated and taking advantage of increasingly ubiquitous connectivty to launch more cyberattacks. SG thus reviewed and refreshed its trategy, first launched in 2016.

Strategic pillar
- build resilient infrastructure
- enable a safer cyberspace
- enhance international cyber cooperation
