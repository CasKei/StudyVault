> - Private key SK (generated by device; kept secret)

When you digitally sign a document $D$,  you are generating a signature $s=sign(h(D), SK)$.

$h$: a cryptographic [[Algo Hash functions|hash function]] known to both you and the recipient of your digitally signed document

Recipient receives both document $D'$ and signature $s'$, and wants to check if $D'=D$ by running $verify(h(D'), s', PK)$.
- Using PK, check if $s'=s$
- Assuming $s'-s$,  running verify will return `false` if $D'\not=D$.
