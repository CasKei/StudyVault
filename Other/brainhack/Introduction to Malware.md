### Types of Malware
#### Trojan
A trojan horse is any malware that misleads users of its true intent. Trojans generall spread by some form of [[Social Engineering]].
i.e. where user is duped into executing an email attachment disguised to not appear suspicious, or by clicking on some fake ad

#### Worm
A type of malware that replicates itself to spread to otehr computers. Often usesa computer network to spread itself, replying on security failures on the target computer to access it.
Many worms are designed only to spread, and do not attempt to change the systems they pass through
#### Logic Bomb
A logic bomb is a malicious piece of code that is secretly inserted into a computer network, operating system, or software application.
The conditions that trigger a logicbomb can be categorised as positive or negative.
Logic bomb attacks can be devastating. There are instances of how logic bombs have wiped the servers of major financial institutions and other organisations. Anything that can disrupt the servers of a large company or institution has the power to cause serious havoc to the organisation itself and the general population it serves.

#### Rootkit
Rootkits are a type of maware that are designed so that they can remain hidden on your computer. Can contain several tools, ranging from programs that allow hackers to steal your passwords to modules that make it easy for them to steal your credit card or banking information.
Can give hackers the ability to subvert or disable security software and track the keys you tap on your keyboard, making it easy for criminals to steal your personal information.
1. Hardware or Firmware
2. Boot Loader
3. Memory
4. Application
5. Kernel

#### Macro
A powerful way to automate common tasks in Microsoft Office, but macro malware use this to infect ur device. Conceals itself in MS Office files and is distributed via email attachments or ZIP files. Uses names that entice or scare people into opening them. May look like invoices, receipts, legal documents, etc.

#### Spyware
Loosely defined as malware designed to enter your device, gather data, then forward it to a 3rd party without your consent.
May also refer to legitimate software that monitors your data for commercial purposes like advertising.

#### USB Attack
An attack where threat actors use a drive to spread malware. May entice victims to pick it up and open it using their computers, or plugged in by attacker themselves.

#### Drive by Download
Unintentional download of malicious code that leaves you open. Can take advantage of an app, OS or browser that contains security flaws due to unssuccessful updates or lack of updates.
- hijack
- spy
- ruin data

#### Dropper
Droppers ard trojans that have been designed to 'install' malware. Generaly managed in the resrouce section, but they are also technologies that are easily detected by anti-virus

#### Phishing
[[Social Engineering]] that utilises human greed or weakness. Pose as other things to lure people.

#### [[Ransomware]]

#### Fileless
Use legitimate programs to infect coputer. Does not rely on files and leaves no footprint, making it challenging to detect and remove.
Fileless attacks fall into the broader category of low-observable characteristics attacks, a type of stealth attack that evades detection by most security solutions and frustrates forensic analysis efforts.

#### Miner ([[Cryptojacking]])
Crypto mining malware is malicious code that takes over a computing device resources so attacker can use the device processing power to track and verify cryptocurrency transactions in a distributed ledger.
