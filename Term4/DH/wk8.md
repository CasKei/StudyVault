Words. Voyant.
Word vectors: semantic linkages between words themselves.
Words as vectors and measure distance between them. Do the same for entire documents too.
Topic modelling: gave another way of looking at texts, but did not provide any notion of causality. We do not know what caused the topics tho.
Writers can be influenced by topics, but also can be influenced by other writers. This is what we call influence.
Influence involves the notion of causality.

Causality is very hard to wrap our minds around; to assign in some form to something.
Anything that we do, like why do you choose to do this, idk how to give you a clear definitive answer. Because everything that we do in the real world is influenced in so many ways by so many different things.

What is influencing Russia to attack Ukraine
1. NATO expansion: Russia threatened
2. Has always been expansionist, under their own internal dynamics, not actions of the West, so this would have happened sooner or later.

There is a time dimension when we consider influence, so how far back in time must we go?

Jockers found some novels misclassified: novels really written by women classified as written by men. There must be sth that departs from the general pattern here.

In style perspective, misclassification means it did not conform to the pattern that the classifier came up with.

We have the notion of the norm. This is what style is, some pattern or norm that one follows. or style is the deviation from a norm.

What is it that makes sth distinctive? When I say 'this is my style', what is it that makes my style distinguishable from everything else?

Simplest measure of similarity between two novels: Euclidean distance
- Euclidean distance or Euclidean metric is the "ordinary" straight line distance between two points in Euclidean space
- With this distance, Euclidian space becomes a metric space
- The Euclidean distance between points p and q si simply the length ofthe line segment connecting them
- We can obtain Euclidean ditance by repeated applications of Pythagoras' Theorem
