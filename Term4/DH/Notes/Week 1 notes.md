# What are the Humanities
Disciplies that investigate the expressions of the human mind
The study of these aspects of human culture takes place in the disciplines of philology, linguistics, musicology, literary studies, theatre studies, philosophy...
The "humanist": one trained in these disciplines: work to make sense of these objects of human culture
The humanities interpret culture to get at the meaning and significance of human culture.
## How do the Humanities differ from SS?
The sciences differ from the humanities in that they study the natural world.
Chemists, for instance, can tell you what the organic compounds are in the paint Michelangelo used in his fresco paintings on the walls and ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, but…
…They cannot tell you what the frescoes on the Sistine Chapel ceiling mean: What is the context of these paintings? What is their aesthetic significance? Cultural significance?

The social sciences in their origin used to treat society too as if society were an object of the natural world.
Social Scientists used to be interested in working out the general laws and principles that governed human societies.

More recently, disciplines such as Anthropology have become increasingly interpretative and have borrowed heavily from the methods of the humanities. Some social science fields, such as Economics and Psychology, however, continue to be focused on developing general theories of human societal behavior.
## Why do we study the Humanities?
People explain things by stories, in relation to past, present, future.
This relativistic kind of thinking is central to the humanities.
- To develop a deeper knowledge of one’s own culture as well as cultures of others. 
- To better understand and interpret oneself, others and humanity in general, through cultural objects and expressions.
- To learn ways to understand and solve complex human problems.
- To acquire and cultivate empathy and tolerance.
- “An unexamined life is not worth living.” (Plato)
## The work of the humanities:
- Interpretation: What are some ways in which a text becomes more meaningful to a reader of the text
- Contextualization: How can a text’s interpretation be made richer by considering it in relation to other texts? 
- Historicization: Where/how does a text fit into the bigger historical picture? 

Note: “A text” is how humanists tend to refer to any cultural object, which can be, but is not limited to, objects consisting of the written word — “text” could also refer to cultural objects that involve visual, sonic and other modalities without any involvement of written text.

## Quantification can help us contextualize
To create a narrative,
quantification helps us understand the picture by helping us construct a model that we can contextualise and then put within the framework of a narrative.

The narrative itself (the telling of the story) remains a "humanities thing" like all stories

So too with "data" and "analysis" using quantification.

# What are the Digital Humanities
The Digital Humanities are about a different way of “doing” humanities — but not necessarily a radically new way 
The Digital Humanities consist, broadly, of two things:
 - Digital Studies: Looking at digital culture and digital technology from a humanistic perspective
 - Computational Humanities: Doing the usual work of the humanities: 
	 - that is, interpretation, contextualization, and historicization of texts (\*) but using digital tools and techniques 
	 -  \* “texts” broadly understood, not just works “written” using “language”

Aspects of the humanities that involves quantitative work carried out computationally (by means of digital computation
A simple example: A word cloud, or “wordle”, created from analyzing a selected group of texts, and identifying the most common among them and their relative proportions
# What does “the digital” do for the humanities?
1. “The digital” may help to quantify texts… but we should be careful about why we are quantifying
	1. Quantification isn’t always a matter of getting more precision. (However, sometimes it is!) (In fact, to think that ‘“to quantify” always makes things more precise’ is a common misconception.) Because, quantification may also be a kind of modeling. (More about that in the next slide) 
2. ”The digital” may make information more intuitively communicable. E.g. by means of visualization after quantification… (as we saw in the case of the Wordle…)

## Quantification
Is a good thing, helps us see with metrics
But can lead us to think we understand something when we actually don't

Might create a false sense of precision.
Quantification is exact but not unto reality, but unto itself.

Messy, unstructured phenomena of all kinds are difficult for humans to wrap our minds around, to make sense of. 
Human-created cultural artifacts are messy and unstructured. However, fortunately, because we are humans ourselves, we do often have an intuitive grasp of them. 
This human intuition does help humanists interpret texts (i.e. cultural objects) of various kinds. 
Quantification, however, adds another tool to our armory to help do this (without replacing existing approaches, which continue to remain important.) 
A striking example of this is: visualization of information. 
The Covid-19 pandemic is an example of this: Since it was completely new and unexpected, models were needed to make sense of what was happening. 
Model-building was (obviously) facilitated by quantification. (So, also, was understanding the predictions made by models.) 
This is often important for public-facing expositions of research (for public education, public policy, etc.): “Telling stories with data” and “public humanities”. 
However, there are important limitations and caveats, as Arjun Appadurai and Paula Kift point out in their essay “Beware the magic of metrics” (2020) that you read…

## Digital Humanities as Generative
Students are making things as they study and perform research, generating not just texts, but also images, interactions.
Things are created, like AI writing articles or creating music, etc.

# What does the humanities do for the digital?
In general, the humanities offer sociohistorical context to make sense of the digital age. 

For instance, analytical frameworks from the humanities let us investigate how questions regarding race, gender, class, disability status, national origins, and other identity markers shape our lives in the digital age. 
In the context of our course, humanistic perspectives can help: 
1. [[#Analyzing digital culture]]
2. [[#Mitigating biases in cultural analytics]]
## Analyzing digital culture
- What might a reply, quote and retweet network suggest about our contemporary global social phenomena such as the Black Lives Matter movement?
- What would data visualization not show?
- What are some ethical concerns about using publicly available data?
## Mitigating biases in cultural analytics
- What should we keep in mind when working with historical corpora?
- How can we keep our own biases in check when conducting cultural analytics?

# Intersectionality
Crossover. How biases that we encounter everyday gets compounded based on our multiple identifiers.
Example, I am Asian and a woman. Thats race and gender. I am 34 year old, thats age. I work at a university, that assumes certain socioeconomic status.
Depending on these, the biases on me multiply.
