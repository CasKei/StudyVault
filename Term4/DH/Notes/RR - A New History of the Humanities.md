Unlike the sciences and the social sciences, the humanities lack a general history. This is puzzling if we realize that for many centuries there was no distinction between humanities and science.

This raises the question as to what extent the distinction between the humanities and science is essential or artificial.

What are the humanities? It is like the notion of ‘time’ in St Augustine: if you don’t ask, we know, but if you ask, we are left empty handed.

Functions of humanities:
- memory: keeping alive the works of the past
- educational: teaching these works to new generations
- critical: interpreting these works to the public at large
- research: asking questions and posing hypotheses regarding humanistic artifacts

Although his work was not based on a positivistic belief in progress, Störig included only linguistics and historiography as humanistic disciplines.

The general history of the humanities has thus remained underexposed in terms of both content and period. This is all the more striking because a large number of histories of science have been written from the nineteenth century onwards.10 And, more recently, general histories of the social sciences have also been produced.11 In other words, from a historiographical point of view, a general history of the humanities is conspicuous by its absence.

There is no central humanistic discipline on which all other disciplines can be modelled.

So far, the histories that have been written are almost exclusively of single humanistic disciplines, such as histories of linguistics, histories of literary theory, and histories of historiography. Connections between methods and principles among different disciplines have rarely been made.
A comparative, interdisciplinary history of these fields is essential. And moreover, we cannot restrict ourselves to one region. It emerges that there is almost nowhere that the history of the humanities can be considered in isolation.

While it seems problematic to directly compare linguistics, poetics, art theory, musicology, and historiography across regions and periods, we may be able to compare the underlying **methods** used in these disciplines as well as the **patterns** found with these methods. Humanities scholars typically employed one or more **methodological principles** to investigate their humanistic material. And in using these principles they searched for some kinds of **patterns** in the material. These principles and **patterns** were sometimes literally mentioned while at other times they remained implicit but could often be extracted from the texts. While the contexts of these humanistic studies differ immensely across disciplines, regions, and periods, there appear to be deep commonalities at the level of principles used and **patterns** found. A comparison between humanistic practices across disciplines, regions, and periods thus seems to be possible in terms of these two concepts.

The focus on principles and patterns also allows us to discern new patterns not found by humanities scholars themselves. These I will call metapatterns.

In this book I thus concentrate on the apparently unbroken strand in the humanities that can be identified as the quest for patterns in humanistic material on the basis of methodical principles.

My approach to the history of the humanities challenges a very dominant view in the philosophy of the humanities. This view, initiated by Wilhelm Dilthey, contends that the humanities (Geisteswissenschaften) are concerned primarily with verstehen (understanding), whereas science (Naturwissenschaften) is about erklären (explaining).

What they should be doing is searching for the motives and intentions of important historical figures. Laying bare these inner mainsprings is more important than studying the external manifestations of the human mind.

In this context one also uses the distinction introduced by Wilhelm Windelband between an idiographic approach to knowledge (which is the study of the unique, the special) and a nomothetic way of studying (which seeks to generalize).

This book will, however, show that the quest for principles and patterns in the humanities is a continuous tradition.
