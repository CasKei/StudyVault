## What this course is about:
This course is an introduction to the principles and methods of digital humanities, an emerging interdisciplinary field that seeks to apply digital and computational methods to investigations in the humanities. In this course, we will discuss the capabilities as well as limitations of computational tools for interpretation in the humanities. The course is structured around the following premise: As technology permeates every corner of human activity, today's engineers and technologists are increasingly called upon to address complex problems in more unstructured contexts and situations than ever before. The humanities, therefore, provide a useful sandbox for students of engineering and technology to understand such complexity and explore how tools that work well for well-structured problems reach their limits of applicability. The course will focus on how computational methods and tools can contribute to the interpretive activities that typically constitute humanistic inquiry, especially to the reading of textual matter as literature. Students will be acquainted with the history of the emergence of the digital humanities and will learn about the leading methodological and epistemological issues in this emerging field. They will also learn about a few classic case studies in the field. Students will carry out a hands-on collaborative project as part of coursework using some of the methods that they will learn about. Digital Humanities is an ideal bridge between technical fields and the humanities. This subject helps students of engineering-and-design address less structured problem-areas than they may have been familiar with from their technically oriented classes, and helps to show them the limitations of their tools when applied to questions of interpretation in the humanities. Thus, the subject of Digital Humanities helps engineering-and-design students gain an understanding of how to operationalize questions that involve relatively unstructured and subjective judgment into actionable design and implementation steps.

## Readings:
All readings will be made available in electronic format on eDimension, either as a pdf document or via a link to an online resource. Some select texts will also be available in hard copy in the library. In order to facilitate a fruitful conversation in class, it is important that all students do assigned readings. I may, at my discretion, occasionally ask students to print out hard copies of the week’s readings to bring to class.

## Learning objectives:
1. Identify the suitability and limitations of digital tools for complex questions
2. Choose, develop and adapt selected Digital Humanities tools to address
questions in the interpretive humanities, especially the interpretation of text.
3. Identify questions in interpretive humanities that can benefit from the use of
Digital Humanities tools and methods.
4. Evaluate published Digital Humanities research.
After taking the course, you will be able to:
1. Define, analyze and describe key concerns in Digital Humanities. ﴾We will
accomplish this through quizzes, which may include short assignments that will
involve applications of principles to concrete use cases.﴿
2. Evaluate and analyze an existing, published Digital Humanities research project
﴾to be selected by students based on their interest﴿; to be submitted as a written
paper of 5-6 pages.
3. Apply key concepts in Digital Humanities in an actual project (exemplified by
your final term-project).

passing grade, students will need to achieve a cumulative score of 50 points or above. Note,
however, that each assignment is mandatory.
For each working day an assignment is late the student will lose 2% of their grade.
Being present and participating in class is very important for students, and attendance will be
taken in each class. Participation is defined as (1) attending class, (2) engaging in class
discussions, (3) fostering a productive learning environment.
Final projects: The final project will be a group project with a single group report, but each
student must also turn in an executive summary of their contributions.

ASSIGNMENTS

Individual mid-term assignment
Deadline: Week 8 (Sunday)
In this mid-term paper, you will be required to create a proposal (2000 words max.) for a
Digital Humanities project inspired by an existing Digital Humanities research project (see a
list of resources below). Having chosen an example project, think, in particular, about the
project’s research topic, objectives, and significance, its underlying research questions, and
its methodology.
Your task, then, is to devise a new project inspired by this study investigating a different
object of analysis (a different corpus of literature or other data set, etc.). You are free to

create a plan for a project about anything you wish, so please use this as an opportunity to
choose a subject in the humanities of interest (e.g. Tolkein’s works).
You should write your proposal as if it were a formal report and make sure you cover the
following:
● Specific research topic, objectives, background, purpose, significance;
● A review of the related research project that inspired you;
● Research questions of your new project;
● Proposed methodology;
● Research limitations (i.e. limitations of the proposed methodology or research approach).

Please find a Digital Humanities research project of interest in the archives of the following
journals:
· Digital Scholarship in the Humanities (DSH)
· Journal of Cultural Analytics (JCA)
· Digital Humanities Quarterly (DHQ)
· Digital Studies/Le champ numérique (DS)

Final group (pairs) assignment
Deadline: Week 13 (Sunday)
In groups of two, you will be required to carry out a small Digital Humanities project of your
choosing. This is an opportunity for you to think beyond your mid-term assignment and to
devise a project together that you have to carry out, complete and report on. You are free to
explore any aspect of the course in your project, to investigate any topic in the humanities
(literature, philosophy, religion, and art), and also to apply any knowledge you think is
applicable from your pillar subjects. You will be required to submit per group a project poster
(PDF) summarizing in a clear and attractive way the results of your study.
For help, see:
“Making a better research poster”
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwMFhyH7_5g
You also need to submit alongside your poster a final project report (2000 words max). This
should be written as a narrative addressing the following points:

· What was the project? What were its research questions? What did it accomplish?
· How did it engage with the humanities? How did you make use of computational
and humanities scholarship to produce new knowledge?
· What did you learn about conducting such a project? What would you do
differently if you were to do it again?
