Review

  This paper explores what does content compel people to see and say, not in a thematic "content analysis" way, but as a digital humanist working in an arts discipline, attending to not only the content's thematics but also its narrative elements.

  This paper examines "content" that have earned 500,000 or more shares on popular social netwroking sites, particularly Facebook and Twitter. Choosing to focus on the headline text, the author narrows on one content genre, which he calls the "uplifting anecdote", which are characterised by its sentimental nature. The author shows that this genre of content embodies many of content's common features, which is an overwhelming concern with the ethical or moral. By doing so, he aims to examine how social media content's rise to prominece is reshaping popular ethics.

  The author argues that social media content, thanks to its particular pursuit of "prosumption", abets a simultaneous expansion and thinning of ethics. It promotes heightened moral concern but simultaneously reduces moral action to aesthetic self-expression -- namely the self-curation in acts like "sharing", "commenting" and "liking". 
  3 part analysis: look broadly at content--its key features, and their ties to prosumption.
  Then look at the uplifting anecdote, conceived of as an embodiment of those features, and analyse the ethics it promotes.
  Then to unpack the implications of that ethics, the author traces some of its dissemination into the broader culture.

  Found that viral content veers towards either the sentimental and ethical or the corrosive and political.
  First, social media content's particular tendency toward sentiment and by extension ethics is fitting. Sentiment is designed to persuade more than accurately depict. It stokes the same two desires for self expression and connection that compel shares, comments and likes.

content: (topic modelling)
- real, sensational events
	- sensational, unifying, uplifting
	- ethical, private or domestic
	- family life, classic objects of sentimental concern
- the self
	- corrosive, upsetting, divisive 
	- political or public realms
	- trump lol
- artifice or craft

1. topic modelling
	1. weighs top topics in order of presence in headlines
2. word frequencies
	1. confirm the above
3. NRC Lexicon (associates english words with 8 different feelings)
	1. confirms dominance of the domestic and unifying over political and controversial, has higher ratio of positive and prosocial feelings to negative or corrosive feelings

next section: establish those less conspicuous affinities and discuss their consequences for the particular type of ethics that the content genre promotes.

sentimental media invoke the ethical in one of 2 ways:
1. inspire sympathetic or altruistic feelings towards the vulnerable parties on whom they often focus.
	1. sympathy for diminutive figures in peril
	2. feelings of moral approval when some heroic person or animal saves the day
	3. such feelings are often assumed
	4. asks audience to feel quasi-universal, unconventional forms of sympathy.
2. compel more divisive responses, asking audiences to feel in ways that codepolitically left or right

run a Naive Bayes classifier on headlines: confirm the above

where critics have discussed the ethics of sentimental media,
1. focus on its sincere pursuit of moral persuasion
Where critics have critiqued sentimenal media's ethics
1. focus on economic aims, how in pursuit of profit, it flatters its audiences into narcissistic quietism.

interesting trend revealed: relative to non uplifting, uplifting headlines are distinguished by the frequency with which they refer, in meta-fashion, to the very processes of content circulation. 5.5 times more likely to use the word 'internet', 5 to 10 times likely to use various words that preemptively describe the content's emotional impact,. Meta-discussion is very likely the result of their insistence on a equation between ethics and online prosumption
Uplifting anecdotes tend to equate moral action not only with self expression, but also with the amateur acts of aesthetic creation and curation that prosumption involves.
