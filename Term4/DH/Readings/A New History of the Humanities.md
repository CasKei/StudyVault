Humanities: the disciplines that investigate the expressions f the human mind.
Include art, language, music, theatre, literature, poetry.
Thus philology, linguistcs, musicology, art history, literary studies, and theatre studies all belong to humanities, unlike the study of nature, which is science.
Similarly, the study of humans in their social context is social science.
BUT math is a product of human mind but not humanistic.

Pragmatic stance: humanities are disciplines taught in humanities faculties.

Humanities have different forms:
- Memory function: keeping alive the works of the past and present through collections
- Educational function: teaching these works to new generations
- Critical function: interpreting these works for the public at large.
- Research function: asking questions and posing hypotheses regarding humanistic artefacts
^ Empirical

BUT to waht extent can expressions of the human mind be empirical? if they are created by people?
Is it not the case that the humanities study primarily the worldin the mind rather than the external one?

In this book I thus concentrate on the apparently unbroken strand in the humanities that can be identified as the quest for patterns in humanistic material on the basis of methodical principles

My approach to the history of the humanities challenges a very dominant view in the philosophy of the humanities. This view, initiated by Wilhelm Dilthey, contends that the humanities (Geisteswissenschaften) are concerned primarily with verstehen (understanding), whereas science (Naturwissenschaften) is about erklären (explaining).18
In this context one also uses the distinction introduced by Wilhelm Windelband between an idiographic approach to knowledge (which is the study of the unique, the special) and a nomothetic way of studying (which seeks to generalize).19
This book will, however, show that the quest for principles and patterns in the humanities is a continuous tradition. Historiography thus appears to be ideally suited to the refutation of philosophical visions

Demarcation. No hard distinction can be made between the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences. Yet since exactly those disciplines that make up the humanities have been historiographically neglected, we have to investigate their joint history before we can write a general history of science or knowledge. 
Comparativism. While it seems problematic to directly compare the study of language, art, literature, music, theatre, and texts—the more if they come from different regions or periods—we can compare them at the level of methods used and patterns found. We can also do this because humanists themselves often (re)used methods and patterns from different disciplines, periods, and regions in new contexts. 
Presentism. Using the present-day meaning of ‘humanities’ in earlier periods is a conceptual anachronism. But given the continuity between the ‘humanities’ in Antiquity, Middle Ages, and modern era, this conceptual anachronism is useful rather than harmful. 
Source selection. If we want to write an overarching history of the humanities, as well as of other disciplines, it is practically impossible for a scholar to consult all sources in their original languages. We have to work together with other scholars to check the sources and to verify the reliability of translations.
