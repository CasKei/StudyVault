$$\log{\frac{1}{p}} = \lg{\frac{1}{N/M}}$$
N = 8, M = 3
$$log(8/3) $$

## Warm Up (Basic)
Suppose that you are to guess the value of a 16-bit number: $0x Z_1Z_2Z_3Z_4$ You are told that the value of $Z_1$ is B. Thus you have been given [N] bits of information. **What is the value of [N]?**

---
The variable $Z_x$ represents strings of 4 bits since these are in hexadecimal number system (indicated with prefix 0x)
We are literally told the first hex digit is B = 1011.
Hence we are given 4 bits of information.
There are still other 12 bits which values we still do not know.

## Keyboard Presses (Basic)
**(a).** Bob used an enhanced keyboard that was made up of 101 keys. He told Alice that he pressed one of the letter keys. **How much information did Bob give to Alice?** Hint: There are 26 letters in an alphabet.
