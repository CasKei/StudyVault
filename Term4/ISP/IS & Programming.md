#### Course Description

This course is an introduction to the design and programming of information systems. Topics include object oriented programming, data structures, mobile system and programming, design pattern and use of software libraries. Sample applications include Internet of Things, Android app and data analytics.

#### Prerequisites

-   [10.014 Computational Thinking for Design](https://sutd.edu.sg/Admissions/Undergraduate/Unique-Curriculum/Freshmore-Subjects/Computational-Thinking-for-Design) (For AY2020 and subsequent batches)

#### Learning Objectives

-   Identify and describe the requirements for an information system.
