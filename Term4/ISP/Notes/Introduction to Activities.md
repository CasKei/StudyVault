## Activities
> An [`Activity`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html) is a single, focused thing that the user can do. It is a crucial component of any Android app. An `Activity` typically has a layout associated with it that defines how UI elements appear on a screen.

The **Configure Activity** screen differs depending on which template you chose. In most cases you can select the following options, if they are not already selected:
-   **Generate Layout file**: Leave this checkbox selected to create the layout resource connected to this `Activity`, which is usually named `activity_main`. The layout defines the UI for the `Activity`.
-   **Backwards Compatibility (AppCompat):** Leave this checkbox selected to include the `AppCompat` library. Use the `AppCompat` library to make sure that the app is compatible with previous versions of Android, even if the app uses features found only in newer Android versions.
