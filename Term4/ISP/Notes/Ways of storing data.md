You learned in [[Data persistence|SharedPreferences]] how to store data in one way.
There are many other options to store data, including:
- the app's internal file storage
- storage space external to app e.g. SD card
- an SQLite database linked to your app
- Firebase realtime database

[[Data persistence|SharedPreferences]] is mainly for storing small amounts of data. For larger amounts of data e.g. images, you need other options.
You can read more about your storage options at [Chapter 9.0](https://google-developer-training.github.io/android-developer-fundamentals-course-concepts-v2/unit-4-saving-user-data/lesson-9-preferences-and-settings/9-0-c-data-storage/9-0-c-data-storage.html) of the Android developer
