## Exploring code samples in the Android SDK

You can explore hundreds of code samples directly in Android Studio. Select **Import an Android code sample** from the Android Studio welcome screen, or select **File > New > Import Sample** if you have already opened a project. The Browse Samples window appears as shown below.![ Browsing code samples](https://google-developer-training.github.io/android-developer-fundamentals-course-concepts-v2/images/1-4-c-resources_to_help_you_learn/browse_samples.png " Browsing code samples")

Select a sample (such as **Camera2Basic**) and click **Next**. Accept or edit the Application name and Project location, and click **Finish**. The app project appears as shown below, and you can run the app in the emulator provided with Android Studio, or on a connected device.![ Exploring the Camera2Basic code sample](https://google-developer-training.github.io/android-developer-fundamentals-course-concepts-v2/images/1-4-c-resources_to_help_you_learn/camera2_project_emulator.png " Exploring the Camera2Basic code sample")

**Note:** The samples are meant to be a starting point for further development. We encourage you to design and build your own ideas into them.

## Using Activity templates
Android Studio provides templates for common and recommended activity designs. Using templates saves time, and helps you follow best practices for developing activities.

Each template incorporates an skeleton activity and user interface. You select an activity template for the main activity when starting an app project. You can also add an activity template to an existing project. Right-click the **java** folder in **Project > Android** pane and select **New > Activity > Gallery**.![ Activity templates](https://google-developer-training.github.io/android-developer-fundamentals-course-concepts-v2/images/1-4-c-resources_to_help_you_learn/add_activity_template.png " Activity templates")
