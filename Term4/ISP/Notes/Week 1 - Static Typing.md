# Static Typing
- Java vs Python: Java requires declaration of the variabls, specifying the types of variables
- The variable type stipulates:
	- the set of values that can be taken
	- the operations that can be performed on those values
- Java is a statically-typed language
```java
public class StaticTyping {
	/**
	* @param args
	*/
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		//TODO Autogenerated method stub
		int var = 1;
		System.out.println(var);
		String var1 = "Hello";
		System.out.println(var1);
	}
}
```
```python
var = 1
print var
var = 'hi'
print var
```
No declaration, variable types depend on the results of assignments / program execution
## Python is not statically-typed (dynamically-typed)
- No declaration, variable types dependon resutls of assignments / program execution
- Sometimes impossible to resolve the variable type before program execution
```python
var1 = 1
userInput = int(input("enter a number: "))
if userInput > 1:
	var2 = 'hello'
else:
	var2 = 10
var3 = var1 + var2
print var3
```
## Java is statically-typed
- Java is a statically-typed language.
- The types of all variables are known at compile time
- Can perform type checking statically (checking before the program even runs)
- In dynamically-typed languages like Python, this type checking is deferred until execution time (while the program is still running)
- Many ideas in this course / modern programming language is to eliminate bugs from the code, and static typing is one idea.
```java
int el = 24;
String e2 = "hello";
e2 = e1;
/* found before program execution */
```

```java
int number = 0;
```
VS
```java
int[] number = {1,2,3};
