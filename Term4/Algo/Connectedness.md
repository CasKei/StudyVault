## Path
> **Undirected graph**: 2 vertices are ==connected== if there is a path connecting these 2 vertices.

**Path**: more formal definition in [[Algo week 9]].
For now look at these illustrations.

## Connectedness
> A graph is **connected** if every 2 vertices in are connected by a path.
> Otherwise, the graph is **disjoint** or disconnected.
