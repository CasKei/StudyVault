## Topological sort
> Topological sort of a [[Directed acyclic graph (DAG)|DAG]]
> $G = (V, E)$

- Run [[Depth-First-Search (DFS)#Algorithm|DFS(G)]], compute finishing times of nodes.
- Outputs the nodes in ==decreasing order of finishing times==.

## Properties
Topological sort applies to a [[Directed acyclic graph (DAG)|DAG]]
