## Cryptographic hash function
[[Cryptographic properties for hash functions]]

> A cryptographic hash function is a [[Algo Hash functions|hash function]] $h(k)$ that satsifies the following properties:
> - Pre-image resistance
> - Second pre-image resistance
> - [[Intro to hashing|Collision]] resistance

> Pre-image resistance:
> Given any hash value $z$, it should be difficult or infeasible to find a key value $k$ that satisfies $h(k)=z$

> Second pre-image resistance:
> Given any key value $k$, it should be difficult or infeasible to find a different key value $k' \not= k$ that satisfies $h(k) = h(k')$.

> [[Intro to hashing|Collision]] resistance:
> It should be difficult or infeasible to find two different key values $k$, $k'$ such that $h(k) = h(k')$.

Applications in authenticatoin, digital signatures, etc.
Widely used in finance and tech sectors.

## Example Digital Signatures
[[Digital signature scheme]]
> 2 types of keys in cryptography:
> - Public key PK (publicly available e.g. on the server)
> - Private key SK (generated by device; kept secret)

When you digitally sign a document $D$,  you are generating a signature $s=sign(h(D), SK)$.

$h$: a cryptographic [[Algo Hash functions|hash function]] known to both you and the recipient of your digitally signed document

Recipient receives both document $D'$ and signature $s'$, and wants to check if $D'=D$ by running $verify(h(D'), s', PK)$.
- Using PK, check if $s'=s$
- Assuming $s'-s$,  running verify will return `false` if $D'\not=D$.
