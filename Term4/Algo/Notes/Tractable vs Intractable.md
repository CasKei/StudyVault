## Tractable problems
Given a problem $A$, there could be many possible solutions, with possibly many different time complexities.
> $A$ can be solved in [[Exponential time]] if $A$ has **at least one** algorithmic solution that runs in [[Exponential time]].

> $A$ can be solved in [[Polynomial time]] if $A$ has **at least one** algorithmic solution that runs in [[Polynomial time]].

> **Tractable problem**
> A problem that can be solved in [[Polynomial time]].

[[Sorting, solving recursion|sorting]], [[Single-source shortest path problem]], etc.

## Intractable problems
> **Intractable problem**
> A problem that **cannot** be sloved in [[Polynomial time]].

A problem, without any **known** solution that is able to run in [[Polynomial time]], may not necessarily be intractable.

It must be guaranteed to have **no** possible solutions that suns in [[Polynomial time]].

E.g. [[Go problem]]
