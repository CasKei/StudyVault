## Algorithms
> Algo: any well definde computational proceudre that takes some value, or set of values, as input and performs some action and/or produces some value or set of values as output.

> Correct algo:
> for every input, it halts with the correct output or the correct action performed

> Efficiency:
> the resources needed to run an algorithm on a computer

> Computational problem: a function that maps an input to an output

> Good algo: correct  + fast
> Fast: T(n) should increase slowly as it grows



## Asymptotic Complexity
> Describes $T(n)$ as $n$ grows to $\infty$
