## Exponential time
> An algorithm runs in exponential time if its time complexity is at most $O(n^c)$ for some constant $c$.

- $O(e^n)$
- $O(n!)$

Note: doubly exponential is NOT in exponential
- $O(e^{e^n})$

> We say a problem is **in EXP** if it can be solved in exponential time

- Note: The class [[Polynomial time|P]] is a subclass of EXP. Any problem [[Polynomial time|in P]] is also a problem in EXP.
