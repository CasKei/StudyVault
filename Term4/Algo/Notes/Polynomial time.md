## Polynomial time
> An algorithm runs in polynomial time if its time complexity is at most $O(n^c)$ for some constant $c$.

Includes:
- $O(1)$
- $O(\log n)$
- $O(n)$
- $O(n \log n)$
- $O(n^2)$
 - $O(n^3)$

> We say a problem is **in P** if it can be solved in polynomial time

**P** refers to the class of all problems that are solvable in polynomial time, i.e. the class of [[Tractable vs Intractable|tractable]] problems.
- Note: refers to problems, not solutions or algorithms.
