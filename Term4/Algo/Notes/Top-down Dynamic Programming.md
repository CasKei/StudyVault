## Idea
Start with a [[Sorting, solving recursion|recursive]] solution to the problem, then [[Memoization VS Tabulation|memoize]] it.

This gives a **memoized recursive algorithm** that "remembers" results computed previously

## What
[[Memoization VS Tabulation|Memoization]] of recursive algorithm.
