Software system is built through a series of time-boxed development cycles/iterations leading to tangible and testable additions to the overall system functionality/increments.

This is an expedient model for building systems with initial ambiguity of scope and changing requirements.

Make small steps at each iteration: think abt building wheel before building car
- generates working component early and fast
- can lead to problem of system integration
