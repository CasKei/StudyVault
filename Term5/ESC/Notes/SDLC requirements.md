## Primary activities
- List candidate requirements (user needs/wants)
- Understand system context through domain modelling and business modelling
- Capture functional and non-functional requirements
	- Functional: functionality - system must book ticket if user has paid
	- Non-functional: performance? system must book ticket within 30s

## Use cases
Requirements should be captured in the language of the user.

Use cases help distil the essence of requirements as sets of action-response transactions between the user and the system.
E.g.
- Action <Put $1>  -> Press button > , Response \<Dispense Coffee>
- Action \<Press button> , Response \<Nothing>
