## Hierarchy
Whenever we examine something new or something that seems to be complex, we try to see what common characteristic it shares with other things we know or if it is part of something we have seen earlier.

Key idea:

| Relation  | Example                                  |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| "Is a"    | a car is a locomotion device with wheels |
| "Part of" | a part of a car is the engine            |
