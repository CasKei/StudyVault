[[50.003 Elements of Software Construction|50.003]]

## Spectrum of Languages
For user requirements
- Structured english
	- not visual, not executable, not precise, extremely flexible

For implementation
- [[#Programming languages]]
	- precise, executable, perhaps not good media for communication

For [[Software development process]]
- [[#Modelling languages]]
	- often visual, often not executable, high-level, aiming for communication between different parties in software development process

## Programming Languages
### Generations
| Generations                                        | Languages                                                             | Characteristics                                                                                       |
| -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1st gen (1954 - 1958)                              | FORTRAN I, ALGOL 58, Flowmatic, IPL V                                 | Mainly math, consists only of global data and sub-programs                                            |
| 2nd gen (1959 - 1970)                              | FORTRAN II, ALGOL 60, COBOL, Lisp                                     | Use extended to business applications; AI, subroutines, block structure, data types introduced        |
| 3rd gen (1962 - 1970)                              | PL/I, ALGOL 68, Pascal, Simula                                        | Use extended to wider application, ideas of modules and data abstraction introduced                   |
| The generation gap                                 | C, FORTRAN 77                                                         | Many languages invented with few surviving; small executables, thrust towards standardisation         |
| Enhanced popularity of OOP languages (1980 - 1990) | Smalltalk 80, C++, Ada83, Eiffel                                      | Languages derived from previous ones; the idea of a class as a basic unit of [[Design - Abstraction]] |
| Emergence of frameworks (1990 - present)           | Visual Basic, Javam Python, J2EE, .NET, Visual C++, Visual Basic .NET | Widespread use of integrated development environment(IDE); focus on Web-based systems                                                                                                      |

## Modelling languages
### Why
Documentation
- part of any [[Software development process]]
- forms the basis of an iterative design process
- forms the bases of effective commnication among three parties, through time

There are formal and imformal ones

### Unified Modelling Language
[[UML]]
