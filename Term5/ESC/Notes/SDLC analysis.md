## Key
Key theme if analysis workflow is to understand how and where systems interact, and what it means for the system.

Ideal:
Action <Press “a”>, Response <Do “this”>
Action <Press “b”>, Response <Do “that”>

Real world:
Action <Put $1 -> Press “tea”>, Response <Dispense “tea”>
Action <Press \[any]>, Response <Display “No stock” if tea is finished>

## Also involves
- Detect and remove ambiguities and inconsistencies amongst requirements
- Developing an internal view of the system
- Identifying the analysis classes and their collaborations
	- analysis classes are preliminary placeholders of functionality
