## Design challenge
[[Secure communication]]

## Key establishment schemes
4 major ways to establish shared keys:
- [[Pre-shared key]]
- [[Out-of-band channel]]
- [[Key distribution centre]]
- [[Dynamic key establishment]]

## Applications
[[Diffie-Hellman key exchange]]
[[RSA]]?

Solving the [[Discrete logarithm problem]]
[[Modular Arithmetic#Modular exponentiation]]

## Conclusion
- Keys are fundamentally required for confidentiality and authentication
- They need to be established or exchanged by different ways:
	- [[Key Establishment#Key establishment schemes]]
- DHKE introduces public key Public key cryptography
