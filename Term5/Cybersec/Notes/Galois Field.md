## Definition
> A finite [[Field]].

Order of any finite field:
- $p$ where $p$ is a prime
- or $p^n$ where $p$ is a prime and $n>1$

Written as $GF(p)$ or $GF(p^n)$

> $p$ is called the **characteristic** of the field.

## Example
$$GF(p)$$
- $p$ is prime
- Operation: $+, *$
- In $GF(2)$, + is XOR, * is AND
