[[Modular Arithmetic]]

## Definition
> A field is a [[Ring]] with the following properties:
> - all elements of the field for an additive [[Group]] with the operation $+$ and [[Identity]] element $0$
> - all elements of the field except $0$ form a multiplicative [[Group]] with the [[Group]] operation $*$ and the [[Identity]] 1
> 	- i.e. all non-0 elements have a multiplicative [[Invertibility|inverse]]
> - when the 2 [[Group]]s are mixed,  the [[Distributive]] law holds.
> 	- $\forall a, b, c \in \mathbb{S} : a \times (b\star c) = (a \times b) \star (a\times c)$
