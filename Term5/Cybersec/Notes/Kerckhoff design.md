[[Requirements of system and threat model]]

## Military ciphers
- Practically, if not mathematically, indecipherable
- It must not be required to be secret, and it must be able to fall into the hands of the enemy without inconvenience;
- Its key must be communicable and retainable without the help of written notes, and changeable or modifiable at the will of the correspondents;
- It must be applicable to telegraphic correspondence;

## Takeaways
Example:

System model
- User is applying cipher by hand, must remember key, transmits by telegraph

Attacker model
- Goal: learn the plaintext
- Capability: use math, know the algorithms, capture the ciphertexts

Requirements
- Usable and memorable
- Attacker cannot derive plaintext
