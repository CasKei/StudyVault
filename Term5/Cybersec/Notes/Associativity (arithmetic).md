## Definition
> An operation $star$ on members of a set satisfies associativity iff **in an expression containing 2 or more operators, the order of evaluation does not change the result**.

## Example
$$\mathbb{Z}^+ \text{ and } +, *
$$
- $\mathbb{Z}$ and $+$ is associative
- $\mathbb{Z}$ and $*$ is associative
