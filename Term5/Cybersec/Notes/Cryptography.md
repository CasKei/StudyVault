## Hmst
Alice wants to send secret message $m$ to Bob

Original message $m$ is the **plaintext**

Alice has a shared key $k$ and symmetric encryption function $E(m,k)$

Alice encrypts the plaintext to obtain ciphertext $c=E(m,k)$

Bob receives the ciphertext, and applies key and $D(c,k)$ to decrypt, resulting in plaintext $m=D(c,k)$.
