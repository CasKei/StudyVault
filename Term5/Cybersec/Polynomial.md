We represent elements of $GF(p^n)$ as coefficients of a polynomial of degree $n-1$.
- Coefficients are in $GF(p)$

Example: $GF(2^8)$
$$P(x) = a_7x^7 + a_6x^6 + a_5x^5 + a_4x^4 + a_3x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_1x_1 + a_0$$
- $x$ are placeholders.
- note result of multiplication and divition is modulo a fixed, irreducible polynomial of degree n.
