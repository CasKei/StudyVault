[[C basics for babies]]

## Learning Points
1.  Declare arrays, modify arrays
2.  Print strings, create and modify strings 
3.  Pointers data type: difference between addressing and content 
4.  Addressing in arrays and 64 bits system
5.  Declaring structs, initializing and changing its values

These are the derived data types in C that we will encounter in this class: array (of int, chars - strings, etc), pointer, and structure.

## Arrays
[[C array]]

## Pointers
[[C pointer]]

## 3Strings
[[C string]]

## Structures
[[C struct]]
