Command-line text editor provides a handy way to manipulate text files in terminal without the need of installing any other apps. There are a few options, but two of the most popular ones are [nano](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/42980/the-beginners-guide-to-nano-the-linux-command-line-text-editor/) and [vim](https://opensource.com/article/19/3/getting-started-vim). The latter has a higher learning curve, so we will stick to nano for quick editing.

## nano
You can open any created text file using the command:
-   `nano <path/to/filename>`
-   Then you can start typing as per normal
-   Press **Ctrl + X** to exit, and then **Enter** to save
-   You can press **Ctrl + G** as well to bring up the shortcut menu anytime during editing
- After saving, you can check back the content of the file using the command `cat <path/to/filename>`
