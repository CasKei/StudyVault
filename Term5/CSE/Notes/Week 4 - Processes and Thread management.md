## Process Scheduling
[[Process scheduling]]

## Operations on Processes
We can perform various **operations** on a process: spawning child processes, terminate the process, set up inter-process communication [[Interprocess Communication]] channels, change the process priority, and many more. All of these operations require a [[System calls]] (switching to [[Kernel mode and User mode|kernel mode]]). In this example, we use the **C API** to make the system call.

# Threads
> Threads is defined as a **segment** of a process. A process has **at least** one thread.

A process can have **multiple** threads, and we can define thread as a basic unit of CPU utilization; it comprises of:

-   A **thread ID**,
-   A **program counter**,
-   A **register** set, and
-   A **stack**.

A thread can execute **any** part of the process code, including parts currently being executed by another thread.

The figure below _(taken from SGG book)_ shows the illustration of a single-threaded and multi threaded processes. As shown, it **shares** with other threads belonging to the same process its code section, data section, and other operating-system resources, such as open files and signals. Multiple threads in the same process operates in the **same address space**.

## Multithreading vs Multiprocessing
| Thing                      | [[Multiprocessor System]]                                                                                   | [[Multithreading]]                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Protection and concurrency | Processes have both. Processes are isolated, so there is fault isolation.                                   | Threads only have concurrency but no protection, since code, data, and files are shared between threads of the same process. There is no fault isolation. |
| Communication              | IPC expensive, requires system calls and context switch between processes has high overhead.                | Thread communication has low overhead since they share the same address space. Context switching (thread switching) between threads is much cheaper       |
| Parallel execution         | Parallel process execution always available on multicore system                                             | Parallel thread execution is not always available. Depends on types of threads.                                                                           |
| Synchronisation            | We can rely on OS services (system calls) to synchronise execution between processes, i.e. using semaphores | Careful programming is required (burden on developer) to synchronise between threads                                                                      |
| Overhead cost              |  Processes entirely managed by kernel scheduler: <ul><li>Switch between process executions: FULL(costly) context switch + system call required</li><li>Context of process is large, including flushing cache, managing MMU, since each process lives in different virtual space</li></ul>                                                                                                           |     Threads managed by Thread Scheduler (user space, depending on language):  <ul><li>Lighter context switch sufficient to switch between thread executions</li><li>Context of thread lighter since threads live in same virtual space. Contents that need to be switched involve mainly only registers and stack</li><li>May or may not need to perform system call to access Thread API, depending on types of thread</li></ul>                                                                                                                                                    |

1.  A virtual processor (VP) is a library entity that is usually implicit. For a user thread, the VP behaves like a CPU. In the library, the VP is a kernel thread or a structure bound to a kernel thread. (taken from https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/ssw_aix_72/generalprogramming/thread_models_virtual.html)
2.  cron is a Linux utility which schedules a command or script on your server to run automatically at a specified time and date. A cron job is the scheduled task itself.Â
