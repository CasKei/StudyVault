[[Week 2, 3 - OS Structure]]

Once an operating system is designed, it must be **implemented**. Because operating systems are **collections** of many programs: kernel, system programs, interface, etc, written by **many** people over a **long** period of time, it is difficult to make general statements about how they are implemented[2](https://natalieagus.github.io/50005/os_notes/week2_designstructure#fn:11).

Below are a few common OS structures.

- [[Monolithic structure]]
- [[Layered OS structure]]
- [[Microkernel system structure]]
- [[Hybrid OS structure]]
