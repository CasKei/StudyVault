## Overview
Unlike single-processor systems that we have learned before, multiprocessor systems have two or more processors in close communication, sharing the computer bus and sometimes the clock, memory, and peripheral devices.

Multiprocessor systems have three main advantages:

1.  Increased **throughput**: we can execute many processes in parallel
2.  **Economy of scale**: multiprocessor system is cheaper than multiple single processor system
3.  Increased **reliability**: if one core fails, we still have the other cores to do the work

## Architectures for multiprocessor system
There are different architectures for multiprocessor system.
[[Symmetric architecture]]
[[Multi-core architecture]]

[[Asymmetric multiprocessing]]

## Alternative to multiprocessor systems
[[Clustered system]]
