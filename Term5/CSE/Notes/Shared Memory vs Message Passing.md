| **Number of [[System calls]] made** | Costly (`shmget` and `shmat`) in the beginning to create memory segment (depending on size, [[Pagetable]] update is required during attacking), but **not afterwards** when processes are using them                                                                                                                                                | e.g. via [[Socket]] requires [[System calls]] for each message sent through `send()` and `receive()` but it is much quicker compared to [[Shared Memory]] to use if only small messages are exchanged.                                                                                                                       |
| **Number of processes using**       | Can be shared between **many processes**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | **One-to-one**: only between 2 processes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Usage comparison**                | Costly if only small amounts of data are exchanged. Useful for **large and frequent** data exchange                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Useful for sending **smaller** amounts of data between 2 processes, but if large data exchanged then will suffer from [[System calls]] overhead                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Synchronisation mechanism**       | Requires **additional synchronisation** to prevent **race-condition** issues (burden on developer). There is no [[Types of system calls\\|blocking]] support. It also has to be **freed** after they are no longer needed, otherwise will persist in the system until it is turned off (check for existing shared memoriesusing `ipcs` in terminal) | **Does not require any synchronisation** mechanism (because [[OS Kernel]] will synchronise the two). It will block if required (but can also be set to [[Types of system calls\|non-blocking]] too, i.e. [[Types of system calls\|blocking or non-blocking]] if there's no message to read but one process requests to read) |
