## Message Passing

> Message passing is a mechanism to allow processes to **communicate** and to **synchronize** their actions **without sharing the same address space**. Every message passed back and forth between writer and reader (server and client) through message passing **must be done using kernelâ€™s help**.

Message passing interfaces:
1. [[Socket]]
2. [[Message Queue]]
