## System vs Application Programs
It is often hard to distinguish between system and application (user) programs. Some programs like compiler, assembler, debugger, device drivers, and antivirus can be clearly defined as **system programs**. Programs like media player, photo editing softwares, and video games are clear examples of application programs.

The table below summarises the differences between system programs and application programs (user programs).
