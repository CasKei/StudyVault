# About this course
This course is about the design and implementation of complex computing systems, from single computer systems to a large-scale network of them. At the end of the course, students will be able to:
- Understand and analyse the challenges of designing and implementing complex computing systems, particularly modern operating systems and internet systems.
- Understand and make use of basic tools and methods to overcome the challenges of creating computing systems that are easy to manage, flexible and easy to extend, have high performance, and are reliable and secure.
- Understand and analyse the basic performance of computing systems.

## POSIX-Compliant OS
This subject teaches the basics of OS, in specific we use POSIX compliant OS only as our basis. Having only Windows is **FATAL**, because it means that you can’t do anything during the Lab. We recommend [ArchLinux](https://archlinux.org), but if you’re a beginner you shall install Ubuntu 22.04.

## Course Description
Topics on the engineering of computing and networking systems: design challenges; techniques for controlling complexity; operating systems and networking systems: performance; strong modularity; client-server; naming; security and privacy, atomicity and coordination of concurrent activities; user and end-to-end applications.

Case studies of working systems and readings from the current literature provide comparisons and contrasts.

Students will complete two design/implementation projects.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of the term, students will be able to:
-   Explain sources of complexity in computer system design, e.g. incommensurate scaling and emergent properties.
-   Exploit systems design principles to cope with the complexity, e.g., modularity, hierarchy, layering, indirection.
-   Command software tools to measure performance and understand how actual computing and network systems work.
-   Explain the design and implementation of real-world computing and networking (i.e., Internet) systems, e.g., DNS, HTTP, OpenSSL.
-   Develop programming skills to develop OS and networking tools and software.

## Measurable Outcomes
-   Use software tools to understand, measure, and design modern computing systems.
-   Implement concurrent and network programs in Java.
-   Explain the conceptual underpinnings of modern computing system design; apply relevant principles and techniques in conceptual problem solving.

## Topics Covered
-   Key challenges and basic principles in the design of large-scale computing systems
-   Process management and multithreaded programming
-   Process scheduling, synchronization, deadlock
-   Memory management, file system, and I/O system
-   End-to-end network performance (e.g., loss, throughput, and delay) and impact on network applications
-   Network security: applied cryptography; key certification; confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and availability; types of network attacks; design of secure network protocols
-   Network naming and addressing; DNS as a scalable and distributed infrastructure for name resolution in the Internet
-   Client-server network programming; HTTP and the World Wide Web
