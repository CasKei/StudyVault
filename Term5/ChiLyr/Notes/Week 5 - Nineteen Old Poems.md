[[02.110DH The Chinese Lyrical Tradition - Arts, Literature and Landscape Design]]

## 古诗十九首
The crowning achievement of the Chinese poetic tradition
1. 2nd half of 2nd century A.D
2. By a grp of anonymous Chinese literati but were first brought together by Ciao tong's anthology Wen Xuan "Selection of Refined Literature" in the early 6th century, cos of its uniform use of the 5 char line (五言诗) which eventually dominated the shaping of subsequent lyrical form

## Structure
1. Each line has 5 chars, with a caesura after the second character. Throughout hte poem the same rhyme falls at the end of the second line of the couplet, and each couplet is an independent unit
2. Primary formal characteristic is systematic alternation of discontinuity in the line structure and continuity of the couplet unit
3. A structure of symmetry is based on a new principle of association, in contrast to the earlier principle of repetition found in [[Week 2 - 诗经]].
