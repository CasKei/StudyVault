## 雅 ：Odes
To speak of the affairs of the whole world and to describe customs common to all places is called Ya. Ya means “proper” (zheng). These show the source of either flourishing or ruin in the royal government. Government has its greater and lesser aspects: thus we have a “Greater Ya” and a “Lesser Ya.” The “Hymns” give the outward shapes of praising full virtue, and they inform the spirits about the accomplishment of great deeds. These are called the “Four Beginnings” and are the ultimate perfection of the Poems.

the Analects of Confucius:
-   With the ancient songs, one can inspire, observe, unite, and express resentment as well as learn in great numbers the names of fish, birds, beasts, plants, and trees.
-    Those who fail to study them have nothing to express themselves with (16-13) 
-   And are like a man who “stands with his face straight to the wall”(17-9); 
-   Moreover, the goal was not mere memorization but the ability to properly apply the songs in social intercourse (13-5).

Also Zhou propaganda to show they are very cultured.

## Classic of Poetry CCLXII "We Have in Hand"  周颂·我将
**周颂·我将**
我将我享，
维羊维牛，
维天其右之！
仪式刑文王之典，
日靖四方。
伊嘏文王，
既右飨之。
我其夙夜，
畏天之威，
于时保之。

We have in hand our offerings;
these are sheep, these the cattle, 
may Heaven favor them.
This act is patterned on King Wen's rules,
which daily bring peace to all the land.
Exalted be King Wen! --
he favors us by feeding on them.
May we, early and by night,
	stand in dread of Heaven's might,
and in this way preserve it.
***
The King and ancestors are equal to Gods, and deserve equal worship.
