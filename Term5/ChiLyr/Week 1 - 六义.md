## 诗的分类
### 一曰风 ：Airs
Go both directions in the social hierarchy
Can criticise authority as long as poem well-formed, poet will not be punished.

When the Way of the King declined, rites and morals were abandoned, the government's power to teach has failed.

The government of the domains have changed; the customs of the family have altered.

Then changed Feng (变风) and changed Ya (变雅) were written.

The historians of the domains understood clearly the marks of success and failure; they were pained by the abandonment of proper human relations and lamented the severity of punishments and governance. They sang their feelings to criticize those above, understanding the changes that had taken place and thinking about former customs. Thus the changed Feng emerge from the affections, but they go on further than rites and moral principles. That they should emerge from the affections is human natural; that they go no further than rites and moral principles is the beneficent influence of the former kings.

Thus the affairs of a single state, rooted in the experience of a single person, are called Feng.

### 五曰雅 ：Odes
[[Week 2 - 诗经]]
To speak of the affairs of the whole world and to describe customs common to all places is called Ya. Ya means “proper” (zheng). These show the source of either flourishing or ruin in the royal government. Government has its greater and lesser aspects: thus we have a “Greater Ya” and a “Lesser Ya.” The “Hymns” give the outward shapes of praising full virtue, and they inform the spirits about the accomplishment of great deeds. These are called the “Four Beginnings” and are the ultimate perfection of the Poems.

### 六曰颂 ：Hymns or Eulogies
